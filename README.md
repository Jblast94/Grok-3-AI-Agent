# Grok-3 AI Agent Project

Welcome to the Grok-3 AI Agent project! This repository contains the `agent-twitter-client`, a tool for interacting with Twitter.

## Project Overview

The main application code and its detailed documentation are located in the `agent-twitter-client-0.0.19` directory. This root-level README provides a simplified guide for beginners to get started.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your computer:

1.  **Git:** To clone this repository and manage versions. You can download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).
2.  **Node.js and npm:** This project uses Node.js for its backend and potentially for its UI components. npm (Node Package Manager) comes with Node.js. You can download Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) (it's recommended to install the LTS version).

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to download the project files:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Jblast94/Grok-3-AI-Agent.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
    Change your current directory to the cloned repository:
    ```bash
    cd Grok-3-AI-Agent
    ```

3.  **Navigate to the Application Directory:**
    The main application is inside the `agent-twitter-client-0.0.19` folder. Go into this directory:
    ```bash
    cd agent-twitter-client-0.0.19
    ```

4.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Inside the `agent-twitter-client-0.0.19` directory, you'll find a `package.json` file that lists all the project's dependencies. Run the following command to install them:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    If the project has separate frontend (`ui`) and backend (`backend`) components with their own `package.json` files, you might need to install dependencies in those directories as well:
    ```bash
    # From within agent-twitter-client-0.0.19 directory:
    cd backend
    npm install
    cd ../ui
    npm install
    cd .. # Go back to agent-twitter-client-0.0.19
    ```
    Please check the [detailed README inside `agent-twitter-client-0.0.19/README.md`](./agent-twitter-client-0.0.19/README.md) for the specific structure.

5.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    The application requires certain secret keys and credentials to interact with Twitter. These are managed using environment variables.
    *   In the `agent-twitter-client-0.0.19` directory (and potentially in the `agent-twitter-client-0.0.19/backend` directory), you'll find an `.env.example` file.
    *   Make a copy of this file and name it `.env`.
        ```bash
        # Example for the main application directory:
        cp .env.example .env
        # Example for the backend directory (if it exists and has its own .env.example):
        # cd backend
        # cp .env.example .env
        # cd ..
        ```
    *   Open the `.env` file(s) with a text editor and fill in your Twitter API keys, username, password, email, and any proxy URL if needed.
        ```
        TWITTER_USERNAME=your_twitter_username
        TWITTER_PASSWORD=your_twitter_password
        TWITTER_EMAIL=your_twitter_email_if_needed
        # ... and other variables as specified in .env.example
        ```
    *   **Important:** Never commit your `.env` file (with your actual secrets) to Git. The `.gitignore` file in this repository should already be configured to prevent this.

## How to Use (Basic Usage)

Once the setup is complete:

1.  **Running the Application:**
    The exact command to start the application might depend on its structure (e.g., if it's primarily a backend service or has a UI).
    *   Check the `scripts` section in the `agent-twitter-client-0.0.19/package.json` file for commands like `start` or `dev`.
    *   A common way to start a Node.js application is:
        ```bash
        # From within the agent-twitter-client-0.0.19 directory
        npm start
        ```
    *   If the application has separate backend/frontend parts, you might need to start them individually from their respective directories.

2.  **Interacting with the Client:**
    The `agent-twitter-client` can be used as a library in your own Node.js projects or might provide a command-line interface or a UI.
    *   For detailed examples of how to use the scraper's functions (like fetching tweets, sending tweets, etc.), please refer to the **API section** in the [detailed README: `agent-twitter-client-0.0.19/README.md`](./agent-twitter-client-0.0.19/README.md).

## Further Information

*   For **advanced usage, API details, specific features like Grok integration, media handling, and deploying to AWS**, please see the comprehensive [README.md located inside the `agent-twitter-client-0.0.19` directory](./agent-twitter-client-0.0.19/README.md).
*   If you encounter any issues or have questions, you can also check the [original @the-convocation/twitter-scraper repository](https://github.com/the-convocation/twitter-scraper) as this project is based on it.
